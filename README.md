## Git Commands/Terminology: Definition & Examples:
### Repository
##### Repositories are containers that contain refs which are point to objects or other refs. Like a folder with files, except this folder keeps track of all its files history. This is used anytime you utilize git.

### Clone
##### A clone is a copy of a repository that is stored locally rather then on a web server. It can also be defined as the act of making a copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. Clones are still connected to the remote version. This allows users to push local changes to the remote to keep them in sync. This is used when you would like to work on git files in a prefered editor, or when you know you will be suffering from lapses of no internet.

### Fork
##### Forking allows you to clone a repository on the gitHub server side. Then, you can clone it to your local system and push your new repository upstream. Typically used when multiple individuals are working in the same repository and/or files.

### Branch
##### A branch is essentially a lightweight pointer to a commit. This allows you to “branch out”, and make a new state of your current code, while keeping your current code unaffected. So you can theoretically work on a new features to your code without interacting with your main code directly since it is stored in a branch named master. Typically used when you want to try multiple differnt things but your not sure what's the best route and you want to compare. Or when working on a new rendition or version of software

### Commit
##### A commit is essentially a revision to a file or set of files. Every time a commit is made it creates an ID string called the SHA. This is to allow developers to keep a record of all the changes made to a project. Used nearly everytime you use Git. In order to save changes, ypou must commit.

### Merge
##### What a merge does is take changes made from one branch and apply them to another branch. This is the git command software engineers can use to merge changes made in their code with their main code.

### Checkout
##### The checkout command allows you to update a repositories state to a specific point in the project’s development. You can use the checkout command on the command line to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or even to switch to a different version of a file from a different branch. The "checkout" action updates all or part of the working tree. Typically used when you need to work on different branches, create new branches, or explore files.

### Push
##### The push command allows you send changes in code to remote repositories. For example, if an organization has a repository on Github a developer may push their changes to it.
