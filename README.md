## How the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, & continuous integration can improve the productivity & competitiveness of a company:
Benefits of GIT: Git allows companies to view the progress of development and truly understand the process of the development life cycle. It allows for a collaborative environment, which leads to increased productivity. Features such as branching, cloning, pulling and more allows for gathering and sharing information across all development. GIT also allows a company's developers to see how much time and effort their colleagues are putthing in through a feature such as commit. This increases the sense of urgency to produce more and also motivates developers. 

Benefits of Docker: Docker containers allow for VM-like productivity but more focused and precise. Dockers use a single application which truly uses system resources efficiently. Dockers are compartmentalized and also allow for more portable applications, more efficient software usage and more. It is also possible to use multiple containers on a single OS, taking full advantage of all system resources unlike a single Virtual Machine. Overall, Dockers make companies more efficient and able to fully utilize resources, therefore making them at times more precise and focused compared to their competitors. 

Benefits of automated testing: Automated testing enables a company to save time and use resources towards new projects innovation. It eliminates a great amount of manual work, making a company more efficient and productive. Autoamted testing creates consistency and lowers the chances of human error. It can also save money for the company, due to decreased human labor and overhead. An automated process is not only consistent, but accurate in most cases if done correctly. The usage of automated testing will help a company is many aspects related to competitiveness and productivity. 

Benefits of continuous integration: Continuous Integration helps companies and developers to produce reliable code. It also allows for peer review which can assist with discovering errors or bugs. Continuous Integration along with the features mentioned above can help with verifying the accuracy of code and other projects. This also helps the company grow through innovation and mostly helps with the quality assurance of a product. 

Overall, the combination of all of these features help create an environment where developers can create code with peers to assist the company in moving forward with new products in an elegant manner. These features create a collaborative playing field, which helps developers keep up to date with current development. The use of automated testing helps eliminate a great amount of issues that stem from Human error. Continuous integration allows companies and developers to produce efficient and reliable products. 

## GitFlow Workflow Explanation
GitFlow administers the types of braches to create and how to merge them. GitFlow also has a command-line tool called git-flow which can be used a multiple popular operating systems. Git-flow is a wrapper around the popular tool GIT. GitFlow shows the workflow of the Master and Develop branches. The different features of Git allow for collaborative projects and an idea of progress throughout the development life cycle. 

Developers can use branches to indivually work on projects and commit changes when needed. This feature is very convenient becuase it does not effect the original code/project. 

See below for the steps in a GitFlow project:
- Create a develop branch from the master
- Create a release branch from develop (This is more so for software releases)
- Create feature branches from develop
- When a developer is done coding a feature, it is then merged to the develop branch
- When a developer is done with the release branch, it is merged into develop and master
- If there is an issue identified in master, a hotfix branch is created from master
- Once the developers complete the hotfix branch, it is merged into develop and master.
