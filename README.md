## How the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, & continuous integration can improve the productivity & competitiveness of a company:
Benefits of GIT: Git allows companies to view the progress of development and truly understand the process of the development life cycle. It allows for a collaborative environment, which leads to increased productivity. Features such as branching, cloning, pulling and more allows for gathering and sharing information across all development. GIT also allows a company's developers to see how much time and effort their colleagues are putthing in through a feature such as commit. This increases the sense of urgency to produce more and also motivates developers. 

Benefits of Docker: Docker containers allow for VM-like productivity but more focused and precise. Dockers use a single application which truly uses system resources efficiently. Dockers are compartmentalized and also allow for more portable applications, more efficient software usage and more. It is also possible to use multiple containers on a single OS, taking full advantage of all system resources unlike a single Virtual Machine. Overall, Dockers make companies more efficient and able to fully utilize resources, therefore making them at times more precise and focused compared to their competitors. 

Benefits of automated testing: Automated testing enables a company to save time and use resources towards new projects innovation. It eliminates a great amount of manual work, making a company more efficient and productive. Autoamted testing creates consistency and lowers the chances of human error. It can also save money for the company, due to decreased human labor and overhead. An automated process is not only consistent, but accurate in most cases if done correctly. The usage of automated testing will help a company is many aspects related to competitiveness and productivity.
